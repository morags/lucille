# Lucille: a to-do app for the elderly

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for _Lucille_, a todo-app for older users produced as part of a course project in Agile Software Development at Goldsmiths, University of London (April 2022). The design is informed by up-to-date research on usability for older users, and includes such features as skeumorphism, high contrast coloring, simple interactivity, and shallow navigation hierarchy. Other features, such as auditory and haptic feedback, smart text completion, location-based reminders, and multi-platform synchronization, were planned but not executed.
